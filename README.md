# Coursera-deep-learning
Programming solutions to Coursera course "Deep learning" from deeplearning.ai by Andrew NG

This specialization has five courses:
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequence Models

It starts from the basics of machine learning and very fast jumps into deep learning, so you need some background on machine learning to understand this specialization. 

In this respiratory I give you my solutions to the programming assignments. This does not include the data from Coursera, only the Jupyter notebook for the assignment.
